What are you afraid of <br>
You say that you feel so, feel so alive<br>
That's a good thing, no?<br>
What are you afraid of<br>
They've gotten so real<br>
Those things that you feel<br>
But progress is good, no?<br><br>
What is it you're doubting<br>
You know I just found you<br>
Here suddenly<br>
That's a good thing, no?<br>
What is it you're doubting<br>
You're asking me if you can love me more<br>
But onward we move up<br><br>
Don't think I don't know that time had come to rest<br>
All of last night, the world was just us<br>
Block by block the rain had let up<br>
The city stopped and seemed to die<br>
And so right then it was like we'd done the same<br>
Feeling like ghosts, like death had no end<br>
Drifting slow we can't go back now it felt so good<br>
But we were young, too young<br><br>
I've got to find somewhere<br>
No pocket of air can hide you away<br>
They never did exist<br>
Wherever I fly to<br>
I know that the perfect<br>
Nest is a lie<br>
However we move up<br><br>
Don't think I don't know no weather could upset<br>
All of last night, this world was a nest<br>
None of us were starving but we<br>
Just turned our hearts to you and I<br>
Oh why then there could we not have stopped to think<br>
Something gained is another thing lost<br>
Stopped our hearts and stopped our lives from all drifting off<br>
'Cause we were young, too young<br><br>
It's why I mutter my mind<br>
I don't know, I don't know how to hide you<br>
And you do it all the time<br>
Why won't time stand still<br><br>
I know, I know it when you feel that your life<br>
Fires too fast the sounds are too bright<br>
Colors loud it's like a sign that it's dangerous but we were young<br>
I think you should know I'm floating all alone<br>
Drifting, wondering when you'll come back home<br>
But oh, we just can't come apart 'cause when we met<br>
Then we were young, too young</p></div>
